# solid-potato

A thing that takes a webpage and creates a searchable index of all the words.
It probably isn't a potato.

## Design Decisions
Since we were charged with implementing


## Bugs and Future Work
It would be nice if there were other options to restrict the scrape: perhaps by
same page (restricting scraped links to ones with the same base URL), perhaps by
page depth.

The app should notify the user when it fails to scrape a page and why.

App should notify user if they entered a bad URL.

As long as we're scraping words, we might as well scrape other things--links,
images, et cetera.
